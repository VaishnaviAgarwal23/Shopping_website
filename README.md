✨ Features
The ShopZone website includes the following key features:

Responsive Navigation Bar: Links to all major sections of the site (Home, Products, Shopping Cart, Checkout, Login).

Product Listings: The product.html page displays a list of featured products with images (emojis), names, prices, descriptions, and "Add to Cart" links.

Shopping Cart View: The shoppingcart.html page shows a mock-up of items added and calculates a total price (static for this version).

Checkout Form: The checkout.html page provides fields for Full Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Shipping Address, and Payment Method.

User Authentication: Dedicated pages for Login and Sign Up.

Login Validation: Uses script.js to ensure both fields are filled and the password is at least 5 characters long.

Sign Up Validation: Uses inline JavaScript to ensure all fields are filled and that the Password and Confirm Password fields match.

Consistent Design: Utilizes style.css for a uniform, colorful, and modern look across all pages.

💻 How to View
Clone or Download: Get the files onto your local machine.

Open in Browser: Open any of the HTML files (e.g., website.html or home.html) in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

Navigate: Use the links in the navigation bar to explore different sections of the website.

📝 Notes and Next Steps
This is a static representation of an e-commerce site. For a fully functional e-commerce platform, the following would need to be implemented:

Backend Integration: Connect the forms and cart functionality to a server-side language and database.

Dynamic Cart: Implement JavaScript logic to dynamically add, remove, and update products in the shopping cart.

Payment Processing: Integrate with a secure payment gateway for actual transactions.

User Persistence: Implement proper user session management and password hashing for secure authentication.
